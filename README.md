# 🔐 C++ Cybersecurity Study Planner (30 Days)

Welcome to the **C++ Cybersecurity Study Planner** — a structured 30-day roadmap designed to build your skills from zero to cyber-ready.  
This plan focuses on **C++ fundamentals, exploit development basics, system programming, malware concepts, tool development, and reverse engineering**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This study planner is ideal for:
- Cybersecurity beginners wanting to learn system-level programming  
- Students preparing for SOC/DFIR/Malware Analysis roles  
- Developers transitioning into low-level security  
- Anyone who wants hands-on experience with malware-like tools (for learning & defense)

By the end of 30 days, you will be able to:
✔ Build security tools in C++  
✔ Understand memory vulnerabilities  
✔ Write and analyze malware-like programs  
✔ Use reverse-engineering tools  
✔ Build your own mini security toolkit (AV + scanners + monitors)
